    <p>
      Lalibela is one of Ethiopia’s most remarkable sites, known for its rock-hewn churches carved directly from stone in the 12th century. <br>King Lalibela built these eleven monolithic churches to serve as a “New Jerusalem” for Christians who could not make the pilgrimage to the Holy Land.
    </p>
    <p>
      The churches are still in use today and connected through narrow tunnels and passageways. Each church has unique architectural features and spiritual importance.<br> Lalibela is a sacred site for Orthodox Christians and an architectural wonder that attracts visitors from around the world.
